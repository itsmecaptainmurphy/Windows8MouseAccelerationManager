Windows8MouseAccelerationManager
================================

Helps manage the mouse accelaration published by Microsoft for gaming under Windows 8.1

Program should likely be run as administrator as it makes registry changes. It follows the workaround published by Microsoft found at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2908279

YOU ARE USING THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK, I PROVIDE NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE OF FUNCTIONALITY, NOR AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ILL EFFECTS FROM THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.

Like anything that potentially modifies the registry, you should only use this if you feel comfortable with it.

Note: I am not running Windows 8.1 so I cannot verify if this successfully fixes mouse acceleration. I've verified that it adds/deletes the requisite registry keys at the correct location in Windows 7.
